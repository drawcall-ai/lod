# @drawcall/lod

Level of detail for Three.js. Build simplified meshes, baked low-poly meshes, and impostors, then switch between them by on-screen size with smooth dithered fades. Supports individual objects and instanced scenes.

Requires Three.js `WebGPURenderer` (`three/webgpu`).

```sh
npm install @drawcall/lod three
```

Load a model into an existing Three.js scene:

```ts
import { LodLoader } from "@drawcall/lod";

const loader = new LodLoader();
const tree = await loader.loadAsync("/models/tree.glb");
scene.add(tree);
```

Choose generated or authored levels to suit your assets. The [LOD skill](https://github.com/drawcall-ai/lod/blob/main/packages/lod/skills/lod/SKILL.md) covers asset choices, caching, lazy loading, wind, and scene integration. It also ships with the package at `skills/lod/SKILL.md`.

The [city example](https://github.com/drawcall-ai/lod/tree/main/examples/city) demonstrates a large scene with buildings, vegetation, and small props.
